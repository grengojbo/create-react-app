# ‚ò¢ custom-react-scripts ‚ò¢
Latest version of original react-scripts: **1.1.14**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:
> This is **not** a fork of ```create-react-app```. It's just a fork of ```react-scripts``` with simple babel/webpack modifications that can toggle extra features.

The reason for this fork's existence is explained better in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@kitze/configure-create-react-app-without-ejecting-d8450e96196a).

### üí°Features:
* Decorators
* babel-preset-stage-0
* Less
* Sass
* CSS modules
* Sass modules
* Less modules
* Stylus modules

**the features are optional and can be turned on/off individually*

### ‚ùîHow to use it
```create-react-app my-app --scripts-version custom-react-scripts```

Modify the `.env` file in the root of the generated project, and add any of the configuration options below üëá to enable that feature.

The generated project comes with every option turned on by default, but you can remove them at any time by removing the options from the ```.env``` file.

#### Adding to an existing project

```
npm uninstall --save react-scripts;
npm install --save custom-react-scripts;
```

Add a `.env.` file with the desired features.

### üìù Configuration options
=========
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

*([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))*

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you‚Äôre ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

</p>
>>>>>>>>> Temporary merge branch 2

#### Styling
- ```REACT_APP_SASS=true``` - enable SASS support
- ```REACT_APP_LESS=true``` - enable LESS support
- ```REACT_APP_STYLUS=true``` - enable Stylus support
- ```REACT_APP_CSS_MODULES=true``` - enable CSS modules
- ```REACT_APP_SASS_MODULES=true``` - enable Sass modules
- ```REACT_APP_LESS_MODULES=true``` - enable Less modules
- ```REACT_APP_STYLUS_MODULES=true``` - enable Stylus modules
- ```REACT_APP_CSS_MODULE_CLASSNAME_TEMPLATE='module-[sha512:hash:base32]-[name]-[local]'``` - add custom CSS Module hash ident name

Note: to use modules the file must be named in the following format: ```$name.module.$preprocessorName```.

For example ```styles.module.css``` or ```header.module.sass``` or ```footer.module.less```, etc. Files that are not prefixed with module will be parsed normally.

#### Babel
- ```REACT_APP_BABEL_STAGE_0=true``` - enable stage-0 Babel preset
- ```REACT_APP_DECORATORS=true``` - enable decorators support

#### Other
- ```REACT_APP_WEBPACK_DASHBOARD=true``` - Enables connection to the [webpack-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/electron-webpack-dashboard) Electron app (the app must be installed on local machine)

### ü§î Why?
The ```create-react-app``` app doesn't allow user configuration and modifications for few reasons:

* Some of the babel presets and plugins that people might use are experimental.  If they're used in a project and then they don't make it in the ES spec, they will break backwards compatibility.
* It's hard to maintain code for all of these custom configurations that people want to use.

But people still want to use some of these features, and they're either ejecting their CRA app, or just don't use ```create-react-app``` because they're *just* missing **X** feature.

So instead of [searching npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react-scripts) for a ```react-scripts``` fork with the **X** feature you need, this fork provides support for all of these extra features with simply adding a line in the ```.env``` config.

### How does it work?
The CRA team recently [added support](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) for an ```.env``` file in the root of the generated CRA project.

From the original readme:
> To define permanent environment vairables, create a file called .env in the root of your project:
> ```REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef```

I just added support for extra environment variables that actually turn on certain plugins, babel plugins, presets, and loaders in the webpack and babel configs of ```react-scripts```.
=========
## Creating an App

**You‚Äôll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine** (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, run a single command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

*([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))*

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## How to Update to New Versions?

Please refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.

## Philosophy

* **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

* **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

* **No Lock-In:** You can ‚Äúeject‚Äù to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What‚Äôs Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don‚Äôt need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
* A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
* An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria.
* Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can ["eject"](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.

## Popular Alternatives

Create React App is a great fit for:

* **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.
* **Starting new single-page React applications.**
* **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.

Here‚Äôs a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

* If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).

* If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails or Django, or if you‚Äôre **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible.

* If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

* If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and just produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.

* If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) instead. Unlike Create React App, it pre-renders the website into HTML at the build time.

* If you want to use **TypeScript**, consider using [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

* Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.

If you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html).
